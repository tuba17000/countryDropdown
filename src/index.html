    <h1>Phone Prefix Challenge</h1>
    <h5>5th May 2022 - Challenge 01</h5>
    <p>We are looking for technical talent!</p>
    <p>At Finsweet, we're always seeking for the best candidates who can bring Webflow to the next level. If you think you're one of them, we've got a challenge for you ðŸ‘€!</p>
    <p>The Phone Prefix challenge consists in coding a custom dropdown that dynamically loads all countries' data and allows users to select their phone prefix, plus some additional features.</p>
    <p>We provide you with the pre-built component, including a working JavaScript solution so you can test it by yourself. All you have to do is create your own version of the custom code and present it to us ðŸ’ª.</p>
    <p>All submissions will be reviewed with a personal response to the work. All submissions will be considered for part-time or full-time employment at Finsweet. Your submission will not guarantee any relationship with Finsweet.</p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>The following form has a Dropdown component that allows the users to choose their country's phone prefix.<br></br>Here's an exhaustive list of its functionalities:</p>
   <ol>
     <li>All the countries' data is fetched from REST Countries.</li>
     <li>The data is used to populate all the options inside the Dropdown List.</li>
     <li>Each option displays the country's flag and ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code.</li>
     <li>The DropdownÂ Toggle displays the currently selected country's flag and phone prefix.</li>
     <li>On page load, the user's location is detected and set as the default selected option</li>
     <li>The selected option inside the Dropdown List receives Webflow's native Current state.</li>
     <li>When opening the dropdown, the currently selected option is focused into view.</li>
     <li>If the user hits any letter in the keyboard when the dropdown is open, the first option that starts with that letter is focused.</li>
     <li>When an option is selected, the Dropdown List automatically closes and the Dropdown Toggle is focused.</li>
     <li>The entire component is keyboard navigable using the Arrows, Enter, Space and Tab keys.</li>
     <li>All elements in the component have the required ARIA attributes, including the dynamic ones that change based on the currently selected option.</li>
     <li>The selected option's ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code is populated inside a hidden input field in the form.</li>
   </ol>

    <h2>We want to see your version!</h2>
    <p>If you're up for this challenge, we'd like to see your work! You just have to follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Use vanilla JavaScript or TypeScript inside of the provided Webflow project. Sign up for a free Webflow account and then clone the Phone Prefix Challenge project. You can use Chrome Local Overrides to add snippets in the HTML file of the Webflow site.</li>
      <li>Use our developer-starter template to create a new repository, it already contains our day-to-day tooling pre-configured. You can follow the instructions in the README.md file to get started.</li>
      <li>All elements in the Dropdown component already have some selectors applied so you can interact with them. Don't hardcode HTML in your JavaScript code, just clone/mutate the existing DOM elements when required.</li>
      <li>Don't try to copy the bundled code that we've added for demonstration purposes! This is a challenge, be honest and do your best!</li>
      <li>Make sure you follow coding best practices, Typescript will be a plus! Avoid third party libraries for this challenge, we want to see your coding skills!</li>
      <li>Once you're happy with your code, send a link of your live Webflow project and your GitHub repository to alexiglesias@finsweet.com.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Good luck ðŸ’ª!</p>
